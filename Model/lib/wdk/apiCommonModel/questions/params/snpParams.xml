Restrict the SNPs returned by looking across the set of isolates with a call.  For example, say you choose 10 isolates in the isolates parameter and for a SNP, 7 are A, 1 is T and 2 have no call (there were no alleles called due to not meeting the above read frequency threshold, insufficient read coverage or poor quality alignments). Then the "Percent Isolates with Base Call" would be 80% (ie, 8/10 have a call).  The "Minor Allele Frequency" would be 12.5% (of the 8 isolates with a call, 1/8 of them are the minor allele).
