             <br>Mass spectrometry data were obtained from two-dimensional gel electrophoretic protein separations, one-dimensional gel LC-MS/MS and 
             MudPIT analysis of a sporozoite/oocyst excystation mixture of <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>.  A total of approximately 3,500 protein 
             hits were obtained resulting in 1,252 non-redundant protein identifications. In addition a further 100 hits were obtained to sequences 
             which matched a predicted open reading frame, but for which no gene model currently exists. In total these protein identifications 
             represent nearly one third of the entire predicted proteome of <i>C. parvum</i>, although it is unlikely that the entire proteome 
             from all life-stages will be expressed at any one time.

Subcellular proteomic analysis of <i>C. parvum</i> oocysts. Proteome analysis was carried out on two components of the oocyst after excystation. (1) the proteins identified in the sporozoites and (2) the proteins identified belonging to residual oocyst wall.  Furthermore, proteome analysis was also carried on the intact oocyst.  Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify proteins unique to each subcellular component, and also to identify proteins shared between fractions.

         Find genes whose protein product contains a motif pattern that you specify.<p>

           Specify the pattern with a (Perl style) "regular expression".
           (Regular expressions are more powerful than PROSITE patterns.) For
