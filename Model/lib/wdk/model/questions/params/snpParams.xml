        <![CDATA[
Illumina reads for each isolate are aligned to a reference genome for this organism.  This parameter allows you to specify the minimum frequency that an allele must achieve in the alignment before this isolate will be included in that SNP call.  For example, if 100 reads from strain A are aligned at position X and 78 of them are A and 22 are T, the read frequency would be 78%.  Thus, selecting 80 would not include strain A in computing the returned SNP.  Selecting a read frequency of 60 would include strain A when comparing strains at this position.  NOTE: this parameter is particularly important when dealing with diploid (or aneuploid) organisms as one would expect the read frequency to be ~50% for heterozygous SNPs so one would need to set the read frequency to 40% (or less) to identify heterozygous SNPs.  For haploid organisms like Plasmodium, 80% read frequency is a good default for high quality SNP calls.

Finally, restrict the genes that are returned in this search by setting these parameters that allow you to specify the counts of SNPs contained within the gene, normalized counts (ie, SNP counts / KB of gene) and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs within the gene.

        <![CDATA[
The organism you choose will determine the genome to which the SNPs have been mapped.  That will also restrict the set of isolates you may choose as SNPs are identified by aligning the reads from those isolates to this genome.  Select characteristics in the isolates menu to restrict the isolates you want to compare .... for example, choose Country in the left panel and select the country or countries from which you want to choose isolates for SNP detection.

        <![CDATA[
Restrict the SNPs returned by looking across the set of isolates with a call.  For example, say you choose 10 isolates in the isolates parameter and for a SNP, 7 are A, 1 is T and 2 have no call (there were no alleles called due to not meeting the above read frequency threshold, insufficient read coverage or poor quality alignments). Then the "Percent Isolates with Base Call" would be 80% (ie, 8/10 have a call).  The "Minor Allele Frequency" would be 12.5% (of the 8 isolates with a call, 1/8 of them are the minor allele).
