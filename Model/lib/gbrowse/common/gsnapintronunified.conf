#description   = This shows the distinct untron junctions from the union of all RNASeq experiments.  ISRPM is Intron Spanning Reads Per Million unique intron spanning reads and thus represents a normalized count of unique reads.  Percent of max is the percentage (Unique Reads this junction / Unique Reads of maximum junction for this gene) of this junction over the maximum for this gene. Highest Sample is the sample that has the highest ISRPM.  Best ISRPM / FPKM is the ratio of the ISRPM / FPKM (normalized expression) for the highest sample.  The table shows all experiments and samples that provide evidence for this intron junction.
